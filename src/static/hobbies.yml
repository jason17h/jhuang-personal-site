    - Music has always been a huge part of my life, serving as a crucial outlet for creative and emotional 
      expression. Starting in the year 2008, I spent most of my free time playing the piano until I earned
      my diploma as an Associate of the Royal Conservatory of Music (ARCT) in 2016.
    - In recent years, I've decided to expand my musical horizons and learn to play more instruments in my 
      free ime – from the alto and tenor saxophones to the violin. I also spent some years teaching piano at 
      Mississauga Piano Studios in Mississauga, ON.

    - Typically, we think of a "passionate debater" as a person who loves to argue and find creative ways
      to make their case. The adrenaline of competing and proving a point to an audience is exhilarating but
      is not what drives my passion for debate – for me, it's about watching intelligent people from varying
      backgrounds break down and discuss controversial topics from perspectives I would never have thought to 
      consider. For me, it's about opening my mind and learning new ways to approach problems from an 
      individual to a global scale.
    - White Oaks Secondary School has an incredibly presigious debate team, having made its name on both the
      national and international stages. I had the privilege of serving as the team's President for the
      2017/2018 school year where I helped coach and motivate the team. During my time as an executive,
      we saw White Oaks debaters win the 2018 Junior National Championship in Calgary, AB, and proceed to the
      Grand Final at the 2017 International Competition for Young Debaters held at the University of Cambridge
      in Cambridge, England, among other phenomenal accomplishments.
    - At the University of Waterloo, I continue to feed my love for debate by serving as the Waterloo Debate
      Society's Vice President. Even after 6 years, the creativity and insights I hear at the podium never
      fails to amaze me!
